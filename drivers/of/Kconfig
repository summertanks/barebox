	  barebox supports being configured from devicetree. This enables
	  support for this feature. This currently allows to configure the
	  environment path from devicetree and to partition devices. See
	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/barebox/ for more information.

config OF_OVERLAY

	bool "Devicetree overlays"
	help
	  Overlays allow to patch the devicetree. Unlike Linux, Barebox does
	  not patch the live devicetree, but applies the overlays as fixup to
	  the devicetree. Furthermore, overlays cannot be removed after they
	  have been applied.

config OF_OVERLAY_LIVE
	depends on OF_OVERLAY
	bool "Support devicetree overlays on live devicetree"
	help
	  This option allows to use devicetree overlays with the live
	  devicetree. It is not required to apply overlays to any other
	  devicetree.

	  This builds the build-in devicetree with __symbols__, which
	  significantly increases the size of the dtb file.

	  Enable this option only if you actually need the live devicetree
	  while applying in the devicetree overlay. This is usually the case if
	  applying the overlay has other side effects than changing the
	  devicetree.
