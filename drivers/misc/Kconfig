config JTAG
	tristate "JTAG Bitbang driver"
	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	help
	  Controls JTAG chains connected to I/O pins

config SRAM
	bool "Generic SRAM driver"
	help
	  This driver adds support for memory mapped SRAM.

config STATE_DRV
	tristate "state driver"
	depends on OFDEVICE
	depends on STATE

config DEV_MEM
        bool "Generic memory I/O device (/dev/mem)"

config UBOOTVAR
	bool "U-Boot environment storage"
	depends on OFTREE
	help
	  This driver exposes U-Boot environment variable storage as a
	  single mmap-able device, hiding various low-level details
	  such as:
	      - Preamble format differences
	      - Read/write logic in presence of redundant partition

	  While it can be used standalone, it is best when coupled
	  with corresponding filesystem driver.

config ACPI_TEST
	bool "ACPI Test driver"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This is a simple Test driver to test the ACPI bus.

config STARFIVE_PWRSEQ
	bool "StarFive power sequencing driver"
	depends on SOC_STARFIVE
	help
	  This driver sets up a number of StarFive peripherals not matched
	  by more specific barebox drivers by deasserting reset lines, muxing
	  pins and/or enabling clocks. Peripherals set up by this can then
	  be accessed over /dev/mem or used from kernels which still depend
	  on bootloader for initialization.
